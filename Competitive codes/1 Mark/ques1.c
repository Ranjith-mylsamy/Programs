/*The code you provided declares an array a of 5 integers and initializes it with the values {5,1,15,20,25}. It also declares three integer variables i, j, and m.

The first operation is i = ++a[1];. This increments the value of a[1] by 1, changing it from 1 to 2. The value of the expression ++a[1] is the new value of a[1], which is 2. This value is then assigned to i, so i becomes 2.

The next operation is j = a[1]++;. This assigns the current value of a[1] (which is 2) to j, so j becomes 2. Then, the value of a[1] is incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3.

The next operation is m = a[i++];. Since i is currently 2, this assigns the value of a[2] (which is 15) to m, so m becomes 15. Then, the value of i is incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3.

Finally, the values of i, j, and m are printed using the printf function. The output will be: “3,2,15”.*/
